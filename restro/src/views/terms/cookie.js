                We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below.
                Unfortunately in most cases there are no industry standard

                functionality and features they add to this site. It is
                recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure
                whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a
                service that you use.
